dh-make-perl

Create debian packages from perl modules

dh-make-perl will create the files required to build
a debian source package out of a perl package.
This works for most simple packages and is also useful
for getting started with packaging perl modules.

There is an override mechanism in place to handle most of
the little changes that may be needed for some modules
(this hasn't been tested much, though).

Using this program is no excuse for not reading the
debian developer documentation, including the policy,
the perl policy, the packaging manual and so on.
