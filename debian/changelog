  * Moved all the options received from the user to %opts, for better
    code readability
  * When the module to be packaged declares a dependency on a specific
    Perl version, reflect it in the output dependency/build dependency
    information, rather than complaining that no such module exists

  [ gregor herrmann ]
  * Add "It was downloaded from ..." to debian/copyright if called with
    "--cpan $modulename".

  [ Damyan Ivanov ]
  * Added packaging copyright/licensing to the generated debian/copyright
  * Added myself to Uploaders
  * Wrap long fields in debian/control

  [ Frank Lichtenheld ]
  * s/debian/Debian/ in Description

  [ Gunnar Wolf ]
  * Trimmed unneeded whitespace from generated files - Thanks to Kees
    Cook <kees@outflux.net> for the patch! (Closes: #411282)
  * Patched regex for finding the module name when unde Module::Install,
    allowing for whitespace between the "name" string and the module
    name. Thanks to Marc Chantreux for the patch (and the patience ;-) )
  * Replaced the (now deprecated) call to the external program 822-date
    for date -R
  * Started reorganizing the code - All bare open() calls are now
    handled through IO::File; shuffled some functions around so the code
    is more followable
  * Added --core-ok option to allow building core modules (Closes:
    #409017)

dh-make-perl (0.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed the Perl package data parsing function, fixing an unneeded
    warning. Thanks to Johnny Morano for the patch! (Closes: #396846)
  * Generated dependency on Perl was incomplete (it _only_ missed the
    package name :-/ ) - Thanks to Hilko Bengen for pointing it out.
    (Closes: #400400)
  * No longer dies when building Module::Install modules - It now asks
    the user to manually specify the dependencies. (Closes: #396536)
  * Can now specify via command line depends, build-depends and build-
    depends-indep
  * A bit of basic cleaning, trying to deuglify this very much love-
    needing source code
  * Added patch by Jesper Krogh which allows dh-make-perl to generate
    versioned dependency strings (Closes: #364325)

 -- Gunnar Wolf <gwolf@debian.org>  Tue, 28 Nov 2006 11:47:32 -0600

dh-make-perl (0.24) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed Perl package version parsing (Closes: #386086, #393438)
  * Fixed: Was not properly ignoring Subversion/CVS directories when
    called with an implicit --exclude/-i (Closes: #394314)
  * Fixes the cases where Makefile.PL depends on FindBin (Closes:
    #375146)

dh-make-perl (0.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added --requiredeps option, to force dh-make-perl to choke on
    unresolvable dependencies (Closes: #382027)
  * Packages which are not arch-indep will correctly list perl as build-
    depends, not build-depends-indep (Closes: #381148)
  * The version of Perl depended upon for building is the one currently
    installed in the system, as reported by dpkg

 -- Gunnar Wolf <gwolf@debian.org>  Mon, 28 Aug 2006 20:57:15 -0500

dh-make-perl (0.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added patch by Peter Morch <mn3k66i02@sneakemail.com> allowing user again
    to specify packaging version number (which we had, but was trampled upon
    by autodetection code). (Closes: #382039)
  * Updated generated standards-version to 3.7.2, after checking nothing
    specifically refers to Perl packaging. Updated debhelper required
    version to >= 5.0.0 (Closes: #381130)
  * Updated this package's standards-version to 3.7.2 and debhelper
    required version to >= 5.0.0

dh-make-perl (0.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * No longer ignores META.yml due to the silly oversight of yours
    truly, that was handing back an empty hashref :-/ Thanks to Adam
    Sj�gren and to Noel Maddy for two equivalent reports and two
    identical patches. (Closes: #331658, #328687)
  * Added yet-another-case of how to get version information - Thanks to
    Noel Maddy for the patch (Closes: #328700)

dh-make-perl (0.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Generated debian/watch was including the trailing dot as part of the
    version number - fixed
  * Does not die anymore when META.yml is wrongly formed (Closes:

  * Supports also getting information from modules that use
    Module::Install

    needed for correct building of Module::Build-based modules (Closes:
    #315798)

 -- Gunnar Wolf <gwolf@debian.org>  Mon, 29 Aug 2005 11:56:28 -0500

dh-make-perl (0.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed: Module::Depends::Intrusive was unable to find files because

    (Closes: #136732)

  * debian/control: Added dependency on libmodule-depends-perl for dependency
    detection fix.
  * dh-make-perl: Added a function to make a watch file for modules from

    switch to revert the behavior to the old one.
  * Added a Recommends: libmodule-build-perl relationship

    in ::Perl. Applied patch by David Pashley - Thanks! (Closes: #249472)

    changelog. Applied patch semantically equivalent to Edward Bett's,
    thanks! (Closes: #243338)
  * Handles the cases where POD has DETAILS instead of DESCRIPTION, as
    well as cases where the POD files are DOS-like (i.e., lines end with
    \r\n). Applied Edward Betts' patch, thanks! (Closes: #267899)
  * Documented the --build and --install switches in the synopsis,
    forced the module to be built if only --install is specified.
    (Closes: #269606)

dh-make-perl (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Make make clean cleaner.
  * debian/control: I'm a DD now!
  * dh-make-perl:
    + Don't use rename, as it won't work across devices.
    + Rewrite the ugly stuff that inserts the found docs and the changes file
      into the rules file. IMO this whole thing has to be rewritten *sigh*
    + Fix --build switch by calling make directly with the -C switch. Thanks
      for the report to Emanuele Zeppieri <ema_zep@libero.it> (Closes:
      #241159)
    + Work with DEBEMAIL and DEBFULLNAME as dch does.
    + Fix regexp finding the used modules to allow stuff like use Gtk2"-init"
      and Foobar(). Thanks for the report to Eric Schwartz 
      <emschwar@fc.hp.com>. (Closes: #234774)

  ### I'm planning to rewrite dh-make-perl over the next few weeks. Please

  * Let dh-make-perl also work on directories other than ".". (Closes:
    #230382)
  * Apply patch from Gaal Yahas <gaal@forum2.org> to the CPAN code, now
    CPAN.pm itself chooses the default mirror. Thanks Gaal! (Closes: #230409)
  * Fixed "Use of uninitialized value" warnings in the default override file.
  * Introducing the --exclude|i switch to allow people to exclude some files
    from the search for docs and stuff. This defaults to the exclusion of
    CVS/.svn dirs. (Closes: #223411, #227183, #227113)
  * Now prints out the Perl error message when failing to open a file.
  * Add a note to the end of the long description to state that it was
    automagically extracted from the source. (Closes: #226146)
  * Updated both rules.noxs and rules.xs.
  * Updated manpage.

  * Use Build-Depends-Indep for perl instead of Build-Depends to make packages
    lintian clean.

    installed), otherwise just output the list of needed modules. (Closes:

  * Applied patch to enable overrides again. Thanks to Adrian Phillips
    <adrianp@powertech.no>. (Closes: #207822)

    Thanks to Ilya Martynov <ilya@martynov.org>. (Closes: #209059)
